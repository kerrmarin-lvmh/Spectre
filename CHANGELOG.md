# Spectre Changelog

## TBD

### Breaking Changes

- Support for Swift < 4.2 has been dropped.

### Bug Fixes

- Use `as` to cast `XCTIssueReference` to `XCTIssue` so it will compile on Xcode 12.5

### Enhancements

- Reporter type can be set via an environment variable. For example, to use dot
  reporter:

  ```shell
  $ env SPECTRE_REPORTER=dot swift test
  ```

- Additional arguments and options can be passed to Spectre using the
  `SPECTRE_ADDOPTS` environment variable, for example:

  ```shell
  $ SPECTRE_ADDOPTS=Tests/SpectreTests/FailureSpec.swift swift test
  ```

- Spectre can be passed a set of files to filter which tests will be executed.

## 0.9.2 (2020-11-18)

### Enhancements

- Added support for using the XCTest integration on non Apple platforms with
  [swift-corelibs-xctest](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest)

  error with incompatibility between XCTIssue and XCTIssueReference may be
  presented with Swift 5.3.

### Enhancements

## 0.9.0 (2018-09-10)

- Using Spectre in Xcode has be re-hauled, there are now `describe` and `it`
  methods on `XCTestCase` which can be used. When used, these tests will be ran
  directly and reported as XCTest failures and therefore shown in Xcode and
  Xcode sidebar as XCTest failures.

  Use of the global test context, i.e, global `describe` and `it` is no longer
  permitted when using Spectre with XCTest.
